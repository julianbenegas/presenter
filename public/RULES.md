# iA Presenter Format Rules

## Slide Separation

- Separate slides with `---` (three hyphens on their own line)

## Content Visibility

### Always Visible on Slides

- Headlines: `#`, `##`, `###`
- All headlines appear on the actual presentation slide

### Presenter Notes (Speaker Only)

- Body text WITHOUT tabs/indentation
- This text is only visible to the speaker
- Not shown on the actual slides

### Audience-Visible Content

- Text WITH tabs (â‡¥) or 4 spaces at start of line
- This text appears on the actual slides
- Visible to the audience

## Best Practices

- Keep slides simple and focused
- Use presenter notes for detailed explanations
- Only essential content should be indented (visible to audience)
- Each slide should have a clear purpose

## Example Structure

```markdown
# Slide Title

This is a presenter note - only speaker sees this.

    This line is indented - audience sees this on the slide!

---

## Next Slide

More presenter notes here.

    Another audience-visible line.
    Multiple indented lines appear together.
```
