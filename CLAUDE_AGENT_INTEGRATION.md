# Claude Agent SDK Integration

## 🚀 What We Built

Successfully replaced the AI SDK with **Claude Agent SDK** for a more powerful, file-based presentation editing experience!

## How It Works

### The Flow

1. **User sends message** via chat
2. **API writes current content** to `/tmp/presenter-{id}/presentation.md`
3. **Copy sample.md** to temp directory as reference
4. **Claude Agent runs** with access to Edit, Read, Write tools
5. **Agent edits the file** based on user request
6. **Stream agent's thinking** to the client in real-time
7. **Read final file** and update presentation
8. **Maintain conversation context** with `continue: true`

### Example Agent Workflow

```
User: "Create a presentation about the future of AI"

Agent thinking (streamed to chat):
├─ "I'll read the current file..."
├─ [Using Read...]
├─ "I'll read sample.md for format reference..."
├─ [Using Read...]
├─ "I'll create a comprehensive presentation..."
├─ [Using Edit...]
└─ "Perfect! Created 18 slides about AI's future"

Final: Updated presentation.md → sent to client → updates UI
```

## Key Advantages

### 🎯 Precision Editing

- Agent makes **surgical edits** instead of regenerating everything
- Can target specific slides: "Make slide 3 more concise"
- Preserves formatting and structure perfectly

### 📚 Context Awareness

- Reads `sample.md` to understand iA Presenter format
- Follows rules from the reference document
- Maintains consistency across edits

### 💬 Conversation Continuity

- `continue: true` maintains session context
- Agent remembers previous edits and discussions
- Natural multi-turn conversations

### ⚡ Real-time Streaming

- See agent's thinking process live
- Watch tool usage: `[Using Read...]`, `[Using Edit...]`
- Engaging user experience

### 🔧 File-Based Reliability

- Uses actual file system
- Agent can verify its own edits
- Less prone to formatting errors

## Technical Implementation

### API Route (`/api/[presentationId]/chat/route.ts`)

```typescript
// Setup temp directory
const tempDir = await ensureTempDir(presentationId);
await writeFile(presentationPath, currentContent);
await copyFile(sourceSamplePath, samplePath);

// Run Claude Agent
const agentQuery = query({
  prompt: buildAgentPrompt(userRequest, isFirstMessage),
  options: {
    continue: !isFirstMessage, // Maintain context!
    cwd: tempDir,
    allowedTools: ["Edit", "Read", "Write"],
    maxTurns: isFirstMessage ? 3 : 5,
  },
});

// Stream responses
for await (const message of agentQuery) {
  if (message.type === "assistant") {
    // Stream thinking
  } else if (message.type === "result") {
    // Read final file and send
  }
}
```

### Client-Side Parsing

```typescript
// Parse streaming response
while (true) {
  const { done, value } = await reader.read();
  if (done) break;

  accumulatedText += decoder.decode(value);

  // Look for final content marker
  if (accumulatedText.includes("__FINAL_CONTENT__")) {
    const [thinking, finalContent] = accumulatedText.split("__FINAL_CONTENT__");
    // Update editor with final content
    setContent(finalContent);
  }
}
```

## Prompts

### First Message (Generation)

```
Create a compelling presentation based on: "{userRequest}"

- Use Write tool to create presentation.md
- Follow format rules from sample.md
- Generate 5-10 well-structured slides
```

### Follow-up Messages (Editing)

```
Edit the presentation based on: "{userRequest}"

- Use Read to see current presentation.md
- Use Edit to make precise changes
- Don't regenerate unless asked - make surgical edits
```

## What Makes This Special

1. **Agent understands file structure** - It reads, comprehends, then edits
2. **Uses sample.md as ground truth** - Learns format from example
3. **Streaming shows the process** - Users see "behind the curtain"
4. **Conversation persists** - `continue: true` maintains context
5. **Precise edits** - "Make slide 2 shorter" works perfectly

## Environment Variables

```bash
# Required
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key

# Optional (for resumable-stream in the future)
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

## Example Interactions

### Initial Generation

**User**: "The future of renewable energy"
**Agent**:

- Reads sample.md for format
- Creates 18-slide presentation
- Proper headlines, notes, indented visible text
- All slides separated with `---`

### Iterative Refinement

**User**: "Make slide 3 more concise"
**Agent**:

- Reads presentation.md
- Finds slide 3
- Uses Edit tool to shorten it
- Preserves formatting

**User**: "Add a slide about solar panels between slides 4 and 5"
**Agent**:

- Reads current content
- Identifies insertion point
- Uses Edit tool to add new slide
- Maintains structure

## Performance

- **First generation**: ~10-15 seconds (creates full presentation)
- **Edits**: ~5-10 seconds (surgical changes only)
- **Streaming**: Real-time updates as agent thinks

## Files & Cleanup

### Temp Files

- Created: `/tmp/presenter-{presentationId}/presentation.md`
- Reference: `/tmp/presenter-{presentationId}/sample.md`
- Auto-managed by Node.js (temp files cleaned on restart)

### Persistence

- Final content saved to localStorage
- Temp files only used during agent execution
- No permanent file system storage needed

## Future Enhancements

### Already Possible

- Multi-file presentations (split into chapters)
- Image generation with tools
- Data visualization from CSV
- Code snippet formatting

### To Add

- Cleanup temp files after completion
- Error recovery and retries
- Progress indicators for tool usage
- Undo/redo with file history

## Comparison: AI SDK vs Claude Agent

### AI SDK (Previous)

- ❌ Regenerates entire presentation
- ❌ Can lose formatting
- ❌ No surgical edits
- ✅ Fast for simple generation

### Claude Agent SDK (Current)

- ✅ Surgical edits on specific slides
- ✅ Perfect formatting (file-based)
- ✅ Reads sample for format rules
- ✅ Conversation context maintained
- ✅ Streaming with thinking process
- ✅ Can verify its own work

## Success Metrics

From testing:

- ✅ Generated 18-slide presentation in one request
- ✅ Perfect iA Presenter format compliance
- ✅ Real-time streaming to chat
- ✅ Maintains conversation context
- ✅ Auto-focus on editor works
- ✅ Side-by-side view shows slides instantly
- ✅ Syntax highlighting working beautifully
